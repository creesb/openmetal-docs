# **OpenStack User's Manual**

## Private Cloud Core - OpenStack User Manual

Welcome to the OpenStack User's Manual\! This documentation is intended
for users of an OpenStack cloud who do not have administrative access to
their cloud. In this series of guides, you will learn the steps needed
to create the building blocks needed for your cloud workload. Topics
include understanding and creating a network within OpenStack, how to
create instances, and how to create backups of data, to name a few.
There are two primary ways to work in an OpenStack cloud: Through
Horizon or the command line. Because of this, the guides are grouped
into two categories.
